before compiling the code, you need to install autoconf and automake.
1.
cd to the dist directory, and run autoconf, autoreconf,...
2.
cd to build.unix and run ../dist/configure
3.
run make to build vi.
if you get an error that common/options_def.h is missing or something
like that, you need to run ./distrib in dist/ directory.
